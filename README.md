# what i learnt
do not console.log functions and leave the invocations in the file
after testing a function to see if it works, comment out or delete the function call  and continue
take note of the console.log('1 ', parameter, '2 ', parameter). it is very helpful
after you return in a function, nothing below that return line works again
